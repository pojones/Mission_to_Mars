# Mission to Mars 
## Overview
This project focuses on building a webpage using scraped news data from the NASA MARS Planet Science Program and scraped hemisphere images from the GUSS Astrogeology Centerâ€™s catalog. The webscrape is performed using the BeautifulSoup and Splinter modules and uses Mongo as storage for the resulting data. Using bootstrap for formatting and compatibility, the resulting app page contains the latest Mars news story, a refresh button to update the news data, and images of each mars hemisphere. The web app is also mobile-friendly. Additional interactive formatting changes include responsive background images, hover-actions on buttons, and text formatting.
